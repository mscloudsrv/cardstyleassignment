I have created this file to show card style by using html & CSS coding.
In this file I have also used links on **Read More** *Button*.
You can read further paragraph by clicking on ***Read More Button*** 
If you also want to **add** this *link* button in your **HTML** file so you can use this code which is mention below:

```
<form action="https://techterms.com/definition/html" target="_blank">
            <input type="submit" value="Read More" />
        </form>
```

You can find **Screenshot** of runnig code into **Images Folder** file name is ***Card Style Assignment.JPG***
